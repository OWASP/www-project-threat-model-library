## Our Mission

> ðŸŽ¯  
> To enable secure software architectures by democratising threat modeling through open-source, community engagement and AI advancements with clean, vetted and reliable data.

Welcome to the first, open-sourced, structured, peer-reviewed threat modeling dataset. By generating this open-source curated dataset of real-world threat models, we aim to:

1. Promote and contribute to the standardization of threat modelling
2. Contribute to the knowledge exchange between peers by reviewing every model.
3. Improve the security of open-source applications by having them openly threat modeled. Death to security via obscurity!
4. Create a dataset to fine-tune existing pre-trained LLMs to achieve more reliable threat modeling results

## News

[OWASP Threat Dragon](https://owasp.org/www-project-threat-dragon/) to support OWASP Threat Model Library Schema export by end of the year! With also the fact that threat models in the [OWASP Threat Model Cookbook](https://github.com/OWASP/threat-model-cookbook) are imported as examples in Threat Dragon, this will help produce more threat models to push to the library!


## Events

Project was presented at the OWASP Global AppSec in Barcelona on 29th of May 2025, along with the v1.0 release of the schema!


## Road Map

1. **Start Receiving Contributions!**
    - See the schema, uploaded examples and start threat modelling!

3. **Community Engagement:**
    - Workshops and [hackathons](https://airtable.com/appwu5c5wt1zJXhIQ/pagnNjTTHWSMQJIer/form) will be organized to promote collaboration and encourage community involvement.

4. **Threat Modeling for Popular Open Source Software:**
    - Initiatives will be launched to model the security threats of widely used open-source software.

## FAQs

1. **How do I contribute?**

   See our Conributing Tab on the [project page](https://owasp.org/www-project-threat-model-library/)!

2. **What is the CycloneDx TM-BOM?**

   CycloneDx TM-BOM (Threat Model Bill of Materials) is an industry-standard specification that provides a way to describe threat models. The official release is pending! 
   Once TM-BOM is released, there will be another version released of the Threat Model Library Schema to ensure compatibility.

3. **What tools can I use for threat modeling?**

   There are several tools available for threat modeling, both open-source and commercial. Some popular options include:

   - **OWASP Threat Dragon** (open-source)
   - **OWASP pytm** (open-source)
   - **Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool** (free, proprietary)

   You can use any tool you're comfortable with as long as the output can be converted into the JSON format once the schema is published.

4. **How will threat models be reviewed and validated?**

   Threat models submitted to the repository will be reviewed by the maintainers and the community. The review process will ensure that the model adheres to the schema, follows best practices, and provides meaningful insights. Reviewers may request adjustments or additional details before merging.

5. **What happens after I submit a threat model?**

   After submission, the maintainers and community will review the model. If it meets the standards, it will be merged into the library. We encourage contributors to continuously update and refine threat models as new information or threats emerge.

6. **Will there be support or training for beginners in threat modeling?**

   Yes, we plan to offer training resources, workshops, and tutorials for those who are new to threat modeling. These resources will help you understand the key concepts, tools, and best practices in threat modeling.

9. **How do I report issues or suggest improvements to the project?**

   If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, you can open an issue in the projectâ€™s GitHub repository. Be sure to provide as much detail as possible, and if applicable, a proposed solution or workaround.
