# 🌟 Demonstrate Your Brand’s Commitment to Innovation  
### Sponsor the OWASP Threat Model Library (TML)

## 🚀 Shaping the Future of Threat Modeling
The **OWASP Threat Model Library (TML)** is the first open, community-driven dataset that collects real-world threat models.  
It lowers the barriers to entry for developers, engineers, and security teams by providing **reusable examples, structured schemas, and practical templates**.  

By supporting this project, you help move threat modeling from a niche activity to a **widely adopted practice**, embedded in how systems are designed and built.
